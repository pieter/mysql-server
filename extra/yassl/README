*** Complete Build ***

See the notes in Readme.txt for build instructions.

*** Update Build ***

If you have already done a complete build of yaSSL as described in the release
0.0.1 - 0.1.0 notes and downloaded the update to 0.2.0, place the update file
yassl-update-0.2.0.tar.gz in the yaSSL home directory and issue the command:

gzip -cd yassl-update-0.2.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -

to update the previous release.

Then issue the make command on linux or rebuild the yaSSL project on Windows. 

*******************yaSSL Release notes, version 0.1.0

This release of yaSSL contains minor bug fixes, full client and server TLSv1
support including full ephemeral Diffie-Hellman support, SSL type RSA and DSS
signing and verification, and initial stunnel 4.05 build support.



*********************yaSSL Release notes, version 0.0.3

enhancements, and initial ephemeral Diffie-Hellman integration:



*********************

yaSSL Release notes, version 0.0.2

The second release of yaSSL contains minor bug fixes, client certificate
enhancements, session resumption, and improved TLS support including:

- HMAC for MD5 and SHA-1
- PRF (pseudo random function)
- Master Secret and Key derivation routines
- Record Authentication codes
- Finish verify data check

Once ephemeral RSA and DH are added yaSSL will be fully complaint with TLS.



**********************

yassl Release notes, version 0.0.1

The first release of yassl supports normal RSA mode SSLv3 connections with
support for SHA-1 and MD5 digests.  Ciphers include DES, 3DES, and RC4.

yassl uses the CryptoPP library for cryptography, the source is available at
www.cryptopp.com .

yassl uses CML (the Certificate Management Library) for x509 support.  More
features will be in future versions.  The CML source is available for download
from www.digitalnet.com/knowledge/cml_home.htm .

The next release of yassl will support the 3 lesser-used SSL connection modes;
HandShake resumption, Ephemeral RSA (or DH), and Client Authentication as well
as full support for TLS.  Backwards support for SSLv2 is not planned at this
time.


**********************

Building yassl on linux:

use the ./buildall script to build everything.

buildall will configure and build CML, CryptoPP, and yassl.  Testing was 
preformed with gcc version 3.3.2 on kernel 2.4.22.


**********************

Building yassl on Windows:

Testing was preformed on Windows 2000 with Visual C++ 6 sp5.

1) decompress esnacc_r16.tgz in place, see buildall for syntax if unsure

2) decompress smp_r23.tgz in place

3) unzip cryptopp51/crypto51.zip in place

4) Build SNACC (part of CML) using snacc_builds.dsw in the SNACC directory

5) Build SMP (part of CMP) using smp.dsw in the smp directory

6) Build yassl using yassl.dsw


**********************

examples, server and client:

Please see the server and client examples in both versions to see how to link
to yassl and the support libraries.  On linux do 'make server' and 'make
client' to build them. On Windows you will find the example projects in the
main workspace, yassl.dsw.

The example server and client are compatible with openssl.


**********************

Building yassl into mysql on linux:

Testing was done using mysql version 4.0.17.

alter openssl_libs in the configure file, line 21056. Change '-lssl -lcrypto'
to '-lyassl -lcryptopp -lcmapi -lcmlasn -lctil -lc++asn1'.

see build/config_command for the configure command used to configure mysql
please change /home/touska/ to the relevant directory of course.

add yassl/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH because libmysql/conf_to_src does not
use the ssl lib directory though it does use the ssl libraries.

make

make install
