#
# This test is for the DDL blocker
# The goals of the test should be to ensure the following assumptions for
# the behaviour of the DDL blocker hold true.
#
# a) DDL that are running are allowed to complete and backup blocks
# b) backup blocks all DDL even if not part of backup
# c) DDL operations do not block each other
#
# The results of the backup should show (based on statements above):
#
# a) Test result for this assumption: Included in backup
# b) Test result for this assumption: Not included in backup
#
# The test shall run two sets of data definition statements. 
#
# 1) test DDL in progress that block backup and while the backup in progress
#    check that DDLs that start after the backup are blocked
# 2) DDL do not block each other
#
# These set of DDL statements to test include the following. The DDL 
# statements shall be run in sets with each set a separate test. These tests
# will show the assumptions above to be true.

#
# TODO : Add a native driver to the test when one becomes available
#
# Notes
#   You must use a dedicated connection for getting and releasing locks.
# Do not issue a get_lock() or release_lock() in the same connection
# (thread) as code that calls BACKUP_BREAKPOINT(). Using the same connection
# to get/release locks and run code that issues BACKUP_BREAKPOINTs will result
# in an assertion using DEBUG_ASSERT(thd->ull == NULL) from debug_sync_point()
# in item_func.cc.

#
# Four DDL statements and a backup command are specified.
# The first two DDL statements are run as "in progress" when
# the backup starts. The other two DDL statements are run
# when the backup or restore is already running. Tests results
# show the realization of the assumptions above.
