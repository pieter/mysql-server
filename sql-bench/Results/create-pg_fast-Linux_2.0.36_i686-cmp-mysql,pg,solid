Testing the speed of creating and droping tables
All tests are done 1000 times

Okay..Let's make sure that our tables don't exist yet.

Time for book-keeping (1):  0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr  0.00 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Testing create of tables
Time for create_table (1000): 67 wallclock secs ( 1.40 usr  0.14 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Time for book-keeping (1): 14 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr  0.00 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Accessing tables
Time to select_group (1000):  5 wallclock secs ( 0.53 usr  0.14 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
