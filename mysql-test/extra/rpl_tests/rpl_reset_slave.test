# TBF - difference in row level logging
# Temp tables are not replicated in rbr, but it is still good to hit rbr with everthing

# See SHOW SLAVE STATUS displays well after RESET SLAVE (it should display the
# --master-* options from mysqld, as this is what is going to be used next time
# slave threads will be started). In bug 985, it displayed old values (of before
# RESET SLAVE).
# See if slave crashes when doing a CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE twice, separated by
# RESET SLAVE.
