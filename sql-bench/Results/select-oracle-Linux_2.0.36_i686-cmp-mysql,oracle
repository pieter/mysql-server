Testing the speed of selecting on keys that consist of many parts
The test-table has 10000 rows and the test is done with 254 ranges.

Creating table
Inserting 10000 rows
Time to insert (10000): 35 wallclock secs ( 7.91 usr  0.90 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Testing big selects on the table
Time for select_big (70:17207):  7 wallclock secs ( 2.04 usr  0.53 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
369 queries in 9 loops of 10 loops took 648 seconds
Estimated time for select_range (410:714201): 720 wallclock secs (115.93 usr 25.53 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
34853 queries in 4979 loops of 10000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for min_max_on_key (70000): 1207 wallclock secs (78.23 usr 16.69 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
37555 queries in 7511 loops of 10000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for count_on_key (50000): 800 wallclock secs (53.87 usr 11.17 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Estimated total time: 2769 wallclock secs (257.98 usr 54.82 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
