This is a release of MySQL 4.0.11a-gamma for Win32.

NOTE: If you install MySQL in a folder other than
C:\MYSQL or you intend to start MySQL on NT/Win2000
as a service, you must create a file named C:\MY.CNF
or \Windows\my.ini or \winnt\my.ini with the following
information::

[mysqld]
basedir=E:/installation-path/
datadir=E:/data-path/

After your have installed MySQL, the installation
directory  will contain 4 files named 'my-small.cnf,
my-medium.cnf, my-large.cnf, my-huge.cnf'.
You can use this as a starting point for your own
C:\my.cnf file.

If you have any problems, you can mail them to
win32@lists.mysql.com after you have consulted the
MySQL manual and the MySQL mailing list archive
(http://www.mysql.com/documentation/index.html)
