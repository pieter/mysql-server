# Testing of values within INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST              #
#                                                                      #
# Ensure that the values fit to the current event of the connection    #
# and especially that they change if a connection does nothing or      #
# runs some SQL.                                                       #
# Examples:                                                            #
# - change the default database                                        #
# - send some time no SQL command to the server                        #
# - send a long running query                                          #
#                                                                      #

# 1. Please inform me if this test fails because of timing problems.   #
#    I tried to avoid instabilities but the values within the column   #
#    TIME are very sensible to fluctuations of the machine load.       #
#    I had to unify some TIME values with "--replace_result" in cases  #
#    where they are too unstable.                                      #
# 2. Storage engine variants of this test do not make sense.           #
#    -  I_S tables use the MEMORY storage engine whenever possible.    #
#    -  There are some I_S table which need column data types which    #
#       are not supported by MEMORY. Example: LONGTEXT/BLOB            #
#       MyISAM will be used for such tables.                           #
#       The column PROCESSLIST.INFO is of data type LONGTEXT           #
#           ----> MyISAM                                               #
#    -  There is no impact of the GLOBAL(server) or SESSION default    #
#       storage engine setting on the engine used for I_S tables.      #
#       That means we cannot get NDB or InnoDB instead.                #
# 3. The SHOW (FULL) PROCESSLIST command are for comparison.           #
#    The main test target is INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST !          #
#                                                                      #
# Creation:                                                            #
# 2007-08-09 mleich Implement this test as part of                     #
#                   WL#3982 Test information_schema.processlist        #
# 2008-01-05 HHunger Changed time test and long statement test.        #
#                    It could happen that the long statement test      #
#                    fail due to timing problems.                      #
# 2008-04-14 pcrews Changed --replace_columns to include host          #
#                   this is due to failure occurring on Windows        #
#                   Win results included port number as well causing   #
#                   test failures                                      #
