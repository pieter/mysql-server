Testing the speed of selecting on keys that consist of many parts
The test-table has 10000 rows and the test is done with 1.5 ranges.

Creating table
Inserting 10000 rows
Time to insert (10000):  5 wallclock secs ( 1.55 usr  0.28 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Testing big selects on the table
Time for select_big (70:17207):  1 wallclock secs ( 0.17 usr  0.08 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Time for select_range (410:24731):  2 wallclock secs ( 0.43 usr  0.11 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Time for min_max_on_key (70000): 30 wallclock secs (14.91 usr  1.84 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Time for count_on_key (50000): 592 wallclock secs (25.52 usr  3.32 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Total time: 630 wallclock secs (42.58 usr  5.63 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
