   * @param forceSend If true send will occur immediately (see @ref secAdapt)
   *
   * The NDB API will receive tuples from each fragment in batches, and
   * needs to explicitly request from the NDB Kernel the sending of each new
   * batch. When a new batch is requested, the NDB Kernel will remove any
   * locks taken on rows in the previous batch, unless they have been already
   * taken over by the application executing updateCurrentTuple(),
   * lockCurrentTuple(), etc.
   *
   * The fetchAllowed parameter is used to control this release of
   * locks from the application. When fetchAllowed is set to false,
   * the NDB API will not request new batches from the NDB Kernel when
   * all received rows have been exhausted, but will instead return 2
   * from nextResult(), indicating that new batches must be
   * requested. You must then call nextResult with fetchAllowed = true
   * in order to contact the NDB Kernel for more records, after taking over
   * locks as appropriate.
   *
   * fetchAllowed = false is useful when you want to update or 
   * delete all the records fetched in one transaction(This will save a
   *  lot of round trip time and make updates or deletes of scanned 
   * records a lot faster).
   *
   * While nextResult(false) returns 0, take over the record to
   * another transaction. When nextResult(false) returns 2 you must
   * execute and commit the other transaction. This will cause the
   * locks to be transferred to the other transaction, updates or
   * deletes will be made and then the locks will be released.
   *
   * After that, call nextResult(true) which will fetch new records and
   * cache them in the NdbApi. 
   * 
   * @note  If you don't take over the records to another transaction the 
   *        locks on those records will be released the next time NDB Kernel
   *        is contacted for more records.
   *
   * @note  Please contact for examples of efficient scan
   *        updates and deletes.
