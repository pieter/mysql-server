Testing the speed of selecting on keys that consist of many parts
The test-table has 10000 rows and the test is done with 254 ranges.

Creating table
Time for book-keeping (1):  0 wallclock secs ( 0.01 usr  0.00 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Inserting 10000 rows
Time to insert (10000): 41 wallclock secs ( 7.78 usr  0.78 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Time for book-keeping (1):  1 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr  0.00 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Testing big selects on the table
Time for select_big (70:17207):  6 wallclock secs ( 1.99 usr  0.59 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Time for select_range (410:785994): 575 wallclock secs (117.75 usr 24.70 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
47740 queries in 6820 loops of 10000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for min_max_on_key (70000): 881 wallclock secs (75.22 usr 16.26 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
38585 queries in 7717 loops of 10000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for count_on_key (50000): 778 wallclock secs (56.33 usr 12.00 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Time for book-keeping (1):  0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr  0.00 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Estimated total time: 2285 wallclock secs (259.15 usr 54.33 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
