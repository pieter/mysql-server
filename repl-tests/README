This directory contains a set of test cases for replication. To get it
to work on your system, install this version of MySQL on the master and on
the slave, configure them according to the Replication HOWTO in the manual,
modify include/master-slave.inc to specify correct connection parameters
for the master and the slave and do

sh run-all-tests

If you would like to add your own test case, create a directory
test-your-test-case-name, write your own run.test following the examples
in the other test cases. Note that you can create the files containing
the expected output ( master files) by running mysqltest --record < run.test
