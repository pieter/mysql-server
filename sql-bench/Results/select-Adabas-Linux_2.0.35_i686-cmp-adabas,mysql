Testing the speed of selecting on keys that consist of many parts
The test-table has 10000 rows and the test is done with 22 ranges.

Creating table
Inserting 10000 rows
Time to insert (10000): 179 secs ( 7.14 usr  1.96 sys =  9.10 cpu)

Testing big selects on the table
Time for select_big (70:17207):  4 secs ( 0.39 usr  1.12 sys =  1.51 cpu)
Time for select_range (410:127625): 86 secs ( 6.46 usr  8.41 sys = 14.87 cpu)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
17458 queries in 2494 loops of 10000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for min_max_on_key (70000): 2409 secs (44.95 usr 73.42 sys = 118.36 cpu)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
45645 queries in 9129 loops of 10000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for count_on_key (50000): 658 secs (28.37 usr 56.40 sys = 84.77 cpu)

Estimated total time: 3338 secs (87.31 usr 141.31 sys = 228.62 cpu)
