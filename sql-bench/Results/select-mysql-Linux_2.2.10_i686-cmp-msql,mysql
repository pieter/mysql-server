The test-table has 10000 rows and the test is done with 34 ranges.

Creating table
Inserting 10000 rows
Time to insert (10000):  6 wallclock secs ( 2.10 usr  0.30 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)

Testing big selects on the table
Time for select_big (70:17207):  1 wallclock secs ( 0.28 usr  0.07 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)
Time for select_range (400:182200): 11 wallclock secs ( 3.40 usr  0.54 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)
Total time: 18 wallclock secs ( 5.78 usr  0.91 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)
