Testing the speed of selecting on keys that consist of many parts
The test-table has 10000 rows and the test is done with 8.5 ranges.

Creating table
Inserting 10000 rows
Time to insert (10000): 51 secs (51.92 usr  0.00 sys = 51.92 cpu)

Testing big selects on the table
Time for select_big (70:17207): 12 secs (11.92 usr  0.00 sys = 11.92 cpu)
Time for select_range (400:61130): 29 secs (28.45 usr  0.00 sys = 28.45 cpu)
Time for min_max_on_key (70000): 475 secs (474.89 usr  0.00 sys = 474.89 cpu)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
3840 queries in 768 loops of 10000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for count_key (50000): 7825 secs (7824.40 usr  0.00 sys = 7824.40 cpu)

Estimated total time: 8393 secs (8391.74 usr  0.00 sys = 8391.74 cpu)
