   * Each index key can have lower and/or upper bound.  Setting the key
   * equal to a value defines both upper and lower bounds.  The bounds
   * can be defined in any order.  Conflicting definitions is an error.
   *
   * For equality, it is better to use BoundEQ instead of the equivalent
   * pair of BoundLE and BoundGE.  This is especially true when table
   * distribution key is an initial part of the index key.
   *
   * The sets of lower and upper bounds must be on initial sequences of
   * index keys.  All but possibly the last bound must be non-strict.
   * So "a >= 2 and b > 3" is ok but "a > 2 and b >= 3" is not.
   *
   * The scan may currently return tuples for which the bounds are not
   * satisfied.  For example, "a <= 2 and b <= 3" scans the index up to
   * (a=2, b=3) but also returns any (a=1, b=4).
   *
   * NULL is treated like a normal value which is less than any not-NULL
   * value and equal to another NULL value.  To compare against NULL use
   * setBound with null pointer (0).
   *
   * An index stores also all-NULL keys.  Doing index scan with empty
   * bound set returns all table tuples.
   *
   * @param attrName    Attribute name, alternatively:
   * @param anAttrId    Index column id (starting from 0)
   * @param type        Type of bound
   * @param value       Pointer to bound value, 0 for NULL
   * @param len         Value length in bytes.
   *                    Fixed per datatype and can be omitted
