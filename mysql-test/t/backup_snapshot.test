#
# This test is for the consistent snapshot online backup driver
# The test is designed to show that a consistent snapshot
# backup can be taken while data is being inserted and deleted.
#
# The test is testing the driver to ensure it is entering a 
# consistent read state during the backup. There are several
# breakpoints in the code that can be used. The two most 
# useful ones are:
#
#   backup_cs_unlock - occurs after consistent read 
#     transaction has been started and before the open and
#     lock tables.
#
#   backup_cs_reading - occurs after the open and lock
#     tables during the read tables portion.
#
# The following tests test these conditions.
#
# Notes
#   You must use a dedicated connection for getting and releasing locks.
# Do not issue a get_lock() or release_lock() in the same connection
# (thread) as code that calls BACKUP_BREAKPOINT(). Using the same connection
# to get/release locks and run code that issues BACKUP_BREAKPOINTs will result
# in an assertion using DEBUG_ASSERT(thd->ull == NULL) from debug_sync_point()
# in item_func.cc.
