Testing the speed of creating and droping tables
All tests are done 1000 times

Okay..Let's make sure that our tables don't exist yet.

Testing create of tables
Time for create_table (1000): 67 wallclock secs ( 1.51 usr  0.10 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Accessing tables
Time to select_group (1000):  5 wallclock secs ( 0.62 usr  0.03 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Testing drop
