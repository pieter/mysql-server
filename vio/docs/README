Virtual IO library.
IO wrappers for sockets, fd-s, SSL.
Languages:C++

This library is based on work of many others.
They have different policies and I haven't thought up
about resulting licence - GPL, L(essen)GPL, BSD-style, whatever.
The licences are here for reference:
COPYING.mysql:	MySQL licence. Some socket functions.
COPYING.dbug:	Fred Fish's dbug library. I use it extensively ;=)
COPYING.openssl:OpenSSL licence. SSL wrappers.

At the moment there is no real 'Makefile', just config.mk/targets.mk
and Makefile.am to build it as a module in MySQL. Therefore, there
is currently no possibility to build it as a separate library, but
with MySQL-s root Makefile it should just a matter of leaving
everything else out.
