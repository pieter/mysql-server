#
# BUG#16487
#  
# Requirement:
# Multi-updates on ignored tables should not fail even if the slave does 
# not have the ignored tables.
#
# Note table t1, t2, and t3 are ignored in the option file to this test.
#

--echo **** Test case for BUG#16487 ****
--echo **** Master ****
connection master;
CREATE TABLE test.t4 (a int);
CREATE TABLE test.t1 (a int);

# Expect: The row must *not* by updated on slave, since t1 is ignored
UPDATE test.t4 NATURAL JOIN test.t1 SET t1.a=5;

--echo **** Slave ****
sync_slave_with_master;
SELECT * FROM t4;

connection master;
DROP TABLE t1;
DROP TABLE t4;
