/**
 * @file
 *
 * @brief Contains the snapshot backup algorithm driver.
 *
 * This file contains the snapshot backup algorithm (also called a "driver"
 * in the online backup terminology. The snapshot backup algorithm may be
 * used in place of an engine-specific driver if one does not exist or if
 * chosen by the user.
 *
 * The snapshot backup algorithm is a non-blocking algorithm that enables a
 * consistent read of the tables given at the start of the backup/restore 
 * process. This is accomplished by using a consistent snapshot transaction
 * and table locks. Once all of the data is backed up or restored, the locks 
 * are removed. The snapshot backup is a row-level backup and therefore does 
 * not backup the indexes or any of the engine-specific files.
 *
 * The classes in this file use the namespace "snapshot_backup" to distinguish
 * these classes from other backup drivers. The backup functionality is
 * contained in the backup class shown below. Similarly, the restore
 * functionality is contained in the restore class below.
 *
 * The format of the backup is the same as the default backup driver.
 * Please see <code> be_default.cc </code> for a complete description.
