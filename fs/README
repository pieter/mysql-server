MySQL Filesystem

WARNING: Experimental code and known to crash computer.

Instructions, how to get this stuff working:
1. Make sure you have ORBit, includeing development libraries installed. They should be version 0.5.3 or later.
- I am lazy man and use default ones included with my RedHat:
   [root@localhost /root]# rpm -qa | grep ORBit
   ORBit-0.5.3-2
   ORBit-devel-0.5.3-2
   [root@localhost /root]#

2. Prepare kernel to include korbit:
- Get Linux 2.4.1 kernel source. (very possibly this patch works on 2.4.0 without modifications too)
- unpack it
- apply patch named "korbit-kernel-2.4.1-patch" on it.
- make menuconfig
- In section "Networking options":
   ...
   [*]   Kernel ORB (EXPERIMENTAL)
   ...
   <M>     CORBA User-space FileSystem (EXPERIMENTAL)
   ...
- make dep ; make bzlilo ; make modules ; make modules_install
- reboot
- Execute: insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/net/korbit/modules/CorbaFS/client/corba-corbafs-client.o
  You should see "gethostname() = localhost". Look at known bug 3 in the end of this doc.

3. Make sure MySQL server is working on your system
- On my RedHat 7.0 I execute "/etc/init.d/mysqld start"

4. Prepare MySQL FS daemon
- Get MySQL 4.0 from repository OR get MySQL FS source from http://no.spam.ee/~tonu/mysqlfs.html
- unpack it. In MySQL 4.0 source this is located in directory named "fs". cd into it.
- make
- Execute command "./RunServer" 

5. mount MySQL server to disk tree
- Execute command "mkdir /mnt/mysql" 
- Execute command "mount -t corbafs -o `cat /tmp/mysqlcorbafs.ior` none /mnt/mysql/"
- Check you SQL server content by executing "ls -la /mnt/mysql/"

Known bugs:

1. User bugs. fix user ;)

2. MySQL FS daemon will crash or will be stopped when cobrafs is mounted, then there is no way
to unmount disks anymore. This is korbit business to handle such cases and I had no time to dig
into korbit code.

3. host name returned by gethostname() should be "localhost" or korbit will crash. Also "localhost"
must be first string after 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts
