Testing the speed of creating and droping tables
All tests are done 1000 times

Okay..Let's make sure that our tables don't exist yet.

Testing create of tables
Time for create_table (1000): 22 secs (21.35 usr  0.00 sys = 21.35 cpu)

Accessing tables
Time to select_group (1000):  8 secs ( 8.23 usr  0.00 sys =  8.23 cpu)

Testing drop
Time for drop_table (1000): 18 secs (17.98 usr  0.00 sys = 17.98 cpu)

Testing create+drop
Time for create+drop (1000): 41 secs (41.20 usr  0.00 sys = 41.20 cpu)
Time for create_key+drop (1000): 72 secs (72.18 usr  0.00 sys = 72.18 cpu)
Total time: 161 secs (160.95 usr  0.00 sys = 160.95 cpu)
