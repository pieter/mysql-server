# Concurrent UPDATE test
#
# Note: 1. The "--real_sleep 1" are not needed for the test logics itself.
#          I just want to exclude that the visible strange effect is caused
#          by a currently not detected but thinkable bug around timing/when
#          changes become visible ....
#       2. The "--disable_abort_on_error" before and "--enable_abort_on_error"
#          after "reap" are used with the intention to get a reject file.
#          Both lines can be removed from an final testcase if we are sure
#          that "reap" must not get a server error.
