# There are various conditions when a server would regard mysql.event
# table as damaged:
# - the table has more column than specified in the compiled in value, but
# the version of the server which created the table is the same
# - the column count in the table is less than the compiled in value
# - some column has an incompatible type specification (for what is an
# incompatible type specification please refer to the comments in the source
#
# Unfortunately, in order to test a condition, we need to restart the
# server. Therefore, here we test only one simple case: changing the data
# type of the 'body' field to blob.
#
# First, let's do a backup to not depend on actual definition of mysql.event
create table event_like like mysql.event;
insert into event_like select * from mysql.event;
# Now let's alter the table and restart the server
alter table mysql.event
  change column body  body longtext character set utf8 collate utf8_bin;
