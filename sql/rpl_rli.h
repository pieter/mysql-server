  Replication SQL Thread

  st_relay_log_info contains:
    - the current relay log
    - the current relay log offset
    - master log name
    - master log sequence corresponding to the last update
    - misc information specific to the SQL thread

  st_relay_log_info is initialized from the slave.info file if such exists.
  Otherwise, data members are intialized with defaults. The initialization is
  done with init_relay_log_info() call.

  The format of slave.info file:

  relay_log_name
  relay_log_pos
  master_log_name
  master_log_pos

  To clean up, call end_relay_log_info()
