/*****************************************************************************

  MySQL Replication

  Replication is implemented via two types of threads:

    I/O Thread - One of these threads is started for each master server.
                 They maintain a connection to their master server, read log
                 events from the master as they arrive, and queues them into
                 a single, shared relay log file.  A MASTER_INFO struct
                 represents each of these threads.

    SQL Thread - One of these threads is started and reads from the relay log
                 file, executing each event.  A RELAY_LOG_INFO struct
                 represents this thread.

  Buffering in the relay log file makes it unnecessary to reread events from
  a master server across a slave restart.  It also decouples the slave from
  the master where long-running updates and event logging are concerned--ie
  it can continue to log new events while a slow query executes on the slave.

*****************************************************************************/

/*
  MUTEXES in replication:

  LOCK_active_mi: [note: this was originally meant for multimaster, to switch
  from a master to another, to protect active_mi] It is used to SERIALIZE ALL
  administrative commands of replication: START SLAVE, STOP SLAVE, CHANGE
  MASTER, RESET SLAVE, end_slave() (when mysqld stops) [init_slave() does not
  need it it's called early]. Any of these commands holds the mutex from the
  start till the end. This thus protects us against a handful of deadlocks
  (consider start_slave_thread() which, when starting the I/O thread, releases
  mi->run_lock, keeps rli->run_lock, and tries to re-acquire mi->run_lock).

  Currently active_mi never moves (it's created at startup and deleted at
  shutdown, and not changed: it always points to the same MASTER_INFO struct),
  because we don't have multimaster. So for the moment, mi does not move, and
  mi->rli does not either.

  In MASTER_INFO: run_lock, data_lock
  run_lock protects all information about the run state: slave_running, and the
  existence of the I/O thread (to stop/start it, you need this mutex).
  data_lock protects some moving members of the struct: counters (log name,
  position) and relay log (MYSQL_LOG object).

  In RELAY_LOG_INFO: run_lock, data_lock
  see MASTER_INFO
  
  Order of acquisition: if you want to have LOCK_active_mi and a run_lock, you
  must acquire LOCK_active_mi first.

  In MYSQL_LOG: LOCK_log, LOCK_index of the binlog and the relay log
  LOCK_log: when you write to it. LOCK_index: when you create/delete a binlog
  (so that you have to update the .index file).
