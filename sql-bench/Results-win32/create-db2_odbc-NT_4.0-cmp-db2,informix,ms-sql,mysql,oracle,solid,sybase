Testing the speed of creating and droping tables
All tests are done 1000 times

Okay..Let's make sure that our tables don't exist yet.

Testing create of tables
Time for create_table (1000): 389 secs (389.60 usr  0.00 sys = 389.60 cpu)

Accessing tables
Time to select_group (1000):  7 secs ( 7.37 usr  0.00 sys =  7.37 cpu)

Testing drop
Time for drop_table (1000): 106 secs (106.19 usr  0.00 sys = 106.19 cpu)

Testing create+drop
Time for create+drop (1000): 408 secs (408.21 usr  0.00 sys = 408.21 cpu)
Time for create_key+drop (1000): 193 secs (192.75 usr  0.00 sys = 192.75 cpu)
Total time: 1106 secs (1106.62 usr  0.00 sys = 1106.62 cpu)
