# This is for a system with little memory (32M - 64M) where MySQL plays
# a important part and systems up to 128M very MySQL is used together with
# other programs (like a web server)
#
# You can copy this file to
# /etc/mf.cnf to set global options,
# mysql-data-dir/my.cnf to set server-specific options (in this
# installation this directory is @localstatedir@) or
# ~/.my.cnf to set user-specific options.
#
# One can in this file use all long options that the program supports.
# If you want to know which options a program support, run the program
# with --help option.
