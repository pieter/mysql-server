Testing the speed of selecting on keys that consist of many parts
The test-table has 10000 rows and the test is done with 22 ranges.

Creating table
Inserting 10000 rows
Time to insert (10000):  5 secs ( 1.06 usr  1.00 sys =  2.06 cpu)

Testing big selects on the table
Time for select_big (70:17207):  2 secs ( 0.00 usr  0.43 sys =  0.43 cpu)
Time for select_range (410:127625): 28 secs ( 0.88 usr  2.38 sys =  3.26 cpu)
Time for min_max_on_key (70000): 230 secs (10.97 usr 37.42 sys = 48.39 cpu)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
37070 queries in 7414 loops of 10000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for count_on_key (50000): 810 secs (10.62 usr 28.04 sys = 38.66 cpu)

Estimated total time: 1075 secs (23.53 usr 69.27 sys = 92.80 cpu)
