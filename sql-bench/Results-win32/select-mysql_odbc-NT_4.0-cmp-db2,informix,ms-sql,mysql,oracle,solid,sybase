Testing the speed of selecting on keys that consist of many parts
The test-table has 10000 rows and the test is done with 8.5 ranges.

Creating table
Inserting 10000 rows
Time to insert (10000): 18 secs (17.89 usr  0.00 sys = 17.89 cpu)

Testing big selects on the table
Time for select_big (70:17207):  3 secs ( 2.81 usr  0.00 sys =  2.81 cpu)
Time for select_range (400:61130): 12 secs (11.82 usr  0.00 sys = 11.82 cpu)
Time for min_max_on_key (70000): 261 secs (261.04 usr  0.00 sys = 261.04 cpu)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
42345 queries in 8469 loops of 10000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for count_key (50000): 709 secs (709.52 usr  0.00 sys = 709.52 cpu)

Estimated total time: 1003 secs (1003.10 usr  0.00 sys = 1003.10 cpu)
