/*
  A table definition from the master.

  RESPONSIBILITIES

  - Extract and decode table definition data from the table map event
  - Check if table definition in table map is compatible with table
    definition on slave

  DESCRIPTION

    Currently, the only field type data available is an array of the
    type operators that are present in the table map event.

  TODO

    Add type operands to this structure to allow detection of
    difference between, e.g., BIT(5) and BIT(10).

    DESCRIPTION

      Compare the definition with a table to see if it is compatible
      with it.  A table definition is compatible with a table if:

      - the columns types of the table definition is a (not
        necessarily proper) prefix of the column type of the table, or

      - the other way around

      0  if the table definition is compatible with 'table'
