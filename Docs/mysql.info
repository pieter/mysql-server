This is an empty placeholder file for the MySQL manual.

The MySQL manual is now maintained in a separate BitKeeper source tree!
Please see `http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Installing_source_tree.html'
for more info on how to work with BitKeeper.

This file will be replaced with the current `mysql.info' when building
the official source distribution.

You can find a specific manual for any older version of MySQL in the
binary or source distribution for that version.
