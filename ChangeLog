	* sql/log_event.cc (find_and_fetch_row): Added the optimization
	that if a record is found using a key with HA_NOSAME flag set, we
	do not need to compare records to see if it is the correct one.

2005-09-23  Mats Kindahl  <mats@mysql.com>

	* sql/log_event.cc (replace_record): Added function to overwrite
	existing row if there were a duplicate key.

2005-09-17  Mats Kindahl  <mats@mysql.com>

	* mysql-test/t/rpl_row_multi_query.test: This test is explicitly
	for testing that multi-queries are logged as one Query_log_event
	per sub-query instead of one Query_log_event for the entire
	multi-query.

	The test was removed

	* mysql-test/t/rpl_stm_flsh_tbls.test: Added rename_event_pos
	parameter.

	* mysql-test/t/rpl_row_flsh_tbls.test: Added rename_event_pos
	parameter.

	* mysql-test/extra/rpl_tests/rpl_flsh_tbls.test: Takes one
	additional parameter with the position of the RENAME TABLE
	event. The SHOW BINLOG EVENTS is only used to check the presence
	of the RENAME TABLE event and the FLUSH TABLES event.

	* mysql-test/t/rpl_row_err_ignoredtable.test: This test is
	statement-oriented since it tests that errorneous statements are
	sent through the binlog.  This does not happen with RBR, since
	statements are not replicated through the binlog.

	Test was removed.

	* mysql-test/t/rpl_row_loaddata_m.test: This test is purely
	statement-based, so it was removed as a test for row-based
	logging.  The LOAD DATA is not replicated as two statements, but
	is rather replicated using row-based events, and this is a test
	that the correct events are put into the binary log on execution
	of LOAD DATA INFILE.

	Test was removed.
