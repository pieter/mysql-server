The test-table has 10000 rows and the test is done with 34 ranges.

Creating table
Inserting 10000 rows
Time to insert (10000):  5 wallclock secs ( 1.76 usr  0.26 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)

Testing big selects on the table
Time for select_big (70:17207):  1 wallclock secs ( 0.34 usr  0.03 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)
Time for select_range (400:182200): 11 wallclock secs ( 3.46 usr  0.51 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)
Total time: 17 wallclock secs ( 5.57 usr  0.80 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)
