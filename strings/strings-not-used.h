/*  File   : strings.h
    Author : Richard A. O'Keefe.
    Updated: 1 June 1984
    Purpose: Header file for the "string(3C)" package.

    All  the  routines	in  this  package  are	the  original  work   of
    R.A.O'Keefe.   Any	resemblance  between  them  and  any routines in
    licensed software is due entirely  to  these  routines  having  been
    written  using the "man 3 string" UNIX manual page, or in some cases
    the "man 1 sort" manual page as a specification.  See the READ-ME to
    find the conditions under which these routines may be used & copied.
