Testing the speed of selecting on keys that consist of many parts
The test-table has 10000 rows and the test is done with 8.5 ranges.

Creating table
Inserting 10000 rows
Time to insert (10000): 81 wallclock secs (13.55 usr  1.50 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)

Testing big selects on the table
Time for select_big (70:17207):  9 wallclock secs ( 3.35 usr  0.54 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)
Time for select_range (400:61130): 53 wallclock secs (14.24 usr  1.92 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
36078 queries in 5154 loops of 10000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for min_max_on_key (70000): 1166 wallclock secs (155.66 usr 33.79 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
36075 queries in 7215 loops of 10000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for count_on_key (50000): 832 wallclock secs (118.15 usr 25.25 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)

Estimated total time: 2147 wallclock secs (304.96 usr 63.03 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)
