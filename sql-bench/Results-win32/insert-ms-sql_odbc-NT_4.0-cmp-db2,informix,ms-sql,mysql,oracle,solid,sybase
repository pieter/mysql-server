Testing the speed of inserting data into 1 table and do some selects on it.
The tests are done with a table that has 100000 rows.

Generating random keys
Creating tables
Inserting 100000 rows in order
Inserting 100000 rows in reverse order
Inserting 100000 rows in random order
Time for insert (300000): 3592 secs (3591.82 usr  0.00 sys = 3591.82 cpu)

Testing insert of duplicates
Time for insert_duplicates (300000): 286 secs (285.70 usr  0.00 sys = 285.70 cpu)

Retrieving data from the table
Time for select_big (10:3000000): 202 secs (202.02 usr  0.00 sys = 202.02 cpu)
Time for order_by_key (10:3000000): 201 secs (200.90 usr  0.00 sys = 200.90 cpu)
Time for order_by (10:3000000): 250 secs (250.66 usr  0.00 sys = 250.66 cpu)
Time for select_range_prefix (5000:20000): 25 secs (25.49 usr  0.00 sys = 25.49 cpu)
Time for select_range (5000:20000): 24 secs (24.02 usr  0.00 sys = 24.02 cpu)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
70770 queries in 35385 loops of 100000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for select_key_prefix (200000): 1698 secs (1696.55 usr  0.00 sys = 1696.55 cpu)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
73534 queries in 36767 loops of 100000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for select_key (200000): 1634 secs (1634.55 usr  0.00 sys = 1634.55 cpu)

Test of compares with simple ranges
Time for select_range_prefix (20000:43500): 43 secs (43.59 usr  0.00 sys = 43.59 cpu)
Time for select_range (20000:43500): 44 secs (43.58 usr  0.00 sys = 43.58 cpu)
Time for select_group (91): 75 secs (75.48 usr  0.00 sys = 75.48 cpu)
Time for min_max_on_key (3000): 25 secs (24.60 usr  0.00 sys = 24.60 cpu)
Time for min_max (60): 115 secs (115.58 usr  0.00 sys = 115.58 cpu)
Time for count_on_key (100): 18 secs (17.22 usr  0.00 sys = 17.22 cpu)
Time for count (100): 49 secs (49.15 usr  0.00 sys = 49.15 cpu)

Testing update with functions
Time for update_key (500):   8 secs ( 8.00 usr  0.00 sys =  8.00 cpu)
Time for update_key_big (501): 403 secs (402.89 usr  0.00 sys = 402.89 cpu)

Testing delete
Time for delete_key (500): 21 secs (21.33 usr  0.00 sys = 21.33 cpu)
Time for delete_big (12): 186 secs (186.21 usr  0.00 sys = 186.21 cpu)

Insert into table with 16 keys and with a primary key with 15 parts
Time for insert_key (100000): 5181 secs (5181.56 usr  0.00 sys = 5181.56 cpu)

Testing update of keys
Time for update_of_key (256): 674 secs (674.29 usr  0.00 sys = 674.29 cpu)

Deleting everything from table
Time for delete_big (2): 687 secs (686.86 usr  0.00 sys = 686.86 cpu)

Estimated total time: 15454 secs (15453.34 usr  0.00 sys = 15453.34 cpu)
