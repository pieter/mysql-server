   @mainpage Testing C and C++ using MyTAP

   @section IntroSec Introduction

   Unit tests are used to test individual components of a system. In
   contrast, functional tests usually test the entire system.  The
   rationale is that each component should be correct if the system is
   to be correct.  Unit tests are usually small pieces of code that
   tests an individual function, class, a module, or other unit of the
   code.

   Observe that a correctly functioning system can be built from
   "faulty" components.  The problem with this approach is that as the
   system evolves, the bugs surface in unexpected ways, making
   maintenance harder.

   The advantages of using unit tests to test components of the system
   are several:

   - The unit tests can make a more thorough testing than the
     functional tests by testing correctness even for pathological use
     (which shouldn't be present in the system).  This increases the
     overall robustness of the system and makes maintenance easier.

   - It is easier and faster to find problems with a malfunctioning
     component than to find problems in a malfunctioning system.  This
     shortens the compile-run-edit cycle and therefore improves the
     overall performance of development.

   - The component has to support at least two uses: in the system and
     in a unit test.  This leads to more generic and stable interfaces
     and in addition promotes the development of reusable components.

   For example, the following are typical functional tests:
   - Does transactions work according to specifications?
   - Can we connect a client to the server and execute statements?

   In contrast, the following are typical unit tests:

   - Can the 'String' class handle a specified list of character sets?
   - Does all operations for 'my_bitmap' produce the correct result?
   - Does all the NIST test vectors for the AES implementation encrypt
     correctly?


   @section UnitTest Writing unit tests

   The purpose of writing unit tests is to use them to drive component
   development towards a solution that the tests.  This means that the
   unit tests has to be as complete as possible, testing at least:

   - Normal input
   - Borderline cases
   - Faulty input
   - Error handling
   - Bad environment

   We will go over each case and explain it in more detail.

   @subsection NormalSSec Normal input

   @subsection BorderlineSSec Borderline cases

   @subsection FaultySSec Faulty input

   @subsection ErrorSSec Error handling

   @subsection EnvironmentSSec Environment

   Sometimes, modules has to behave well even when the environment
   fails to work correctly.  Typical examples are: out of dynamic
   memory, disk is full,

   @section UnitTestSec How to structure a unit test

   In this section we will give some advice on how to structure the
   unit tests to make the development run smoothly.

   @subsection PieceSec Test each piece separately

   Don't test all functions using size 1, then all functions using
   size 2, etc.
