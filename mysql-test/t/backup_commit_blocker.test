#
# This test is for the commit blocker
# The goals of the test should be to ensure the following assumptions for
# the behaviour of the commit blocker hold true.
#
# a) transactions in progress are not committed until after the backup
# b) transactions that are committing are allowed to commit
# c) transactions that have not started are allowed to start but do not commit
# d) non-transaction statements in progress are allowed to finish
# e) non-transaction statements that have not started are blocked
#
# The results of the backup should show (based on statements above):
#
# a) Test result for this assumption: Not included in backup
# b) Test result for this assumption: Included in backup
# c) Test result for this assumption: Not included in backup
# d) Test result for this assumption: Included in backup
# e) Test result for this assumption: Not included in backup
#
# Note: the statements above assume statements that change data.
#
# The test shall run three sets of data manipulation statements. 
#
# 1) transactional statments only
# 2) non-transactional statements only
# 3) mix of both transactional and non-transactional statements
#
# TODO : Add a native driver to the test when one becomes available
#
# We use a breakpoint named "backup_commit_blocker" which is placed
# strategically in the code to allow the threads to pause at the 
# corresponding location for those goals above.
#
# Notes
#   You must use a dedicated connection for getting and releasing locks.
# Do not issue a get_lock() or release_lock() in the same connection
# (thread) as code that calls BACKUP_BREAKPOINT(). Using the same connection
# to get/release locks and run code that issues BACKUP_BREAKPOINTs will result
# in an assertion using DEBUG_ASSERT(thd->ull == NULL) from debug_sync_point()
# in item_func.cc.
