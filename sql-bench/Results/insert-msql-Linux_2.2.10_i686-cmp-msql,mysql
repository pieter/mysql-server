Testing the speed of inserting data into 1 table and do some selects on it.
The tests are done with a table that has 100000 rows.

Generating random keys
Creating tables
Inserting 100000 rows in order
Inserting 100000 rows in reverse order
Inserting 100000 rows in random order
Time for insert (300000): 105 wallclock secs (37.17 usr  6.05 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)

Testing insert of duplicates

Test of compares with simple ranges
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
2240 queries in 56 loops of 500 loops took 603 seconds
