# Bug 1264
#
# Description: 
#
# When using a ucs2 table in MySQL, 
# either with ucs2_general_ci or ucs2_bin collation,
# words are returned in an incorrect order when using ORDER BY
# on an _indexed_ CHAR or VARCHAR column. They are sorted with
# the longest word *first* instead of last. I.E. The word "aardvark"
# is in the results before the word "a".
#
# If there is no index for the column, the problem does not occur.
#
# Interestingly, if there is no second column, the words are returned
# in the correct order. 
#
# According to EXPLAIN, it looks like when the output includes columns that
# are not part of the index sorted on, it does a filesort, which fails. 
# Using a straight index yields correct results.


#
# Two fields, index
