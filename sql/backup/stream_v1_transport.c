 Carrier format
 --------------

 [backup stream] = [ block ! ... ! block ]

 [block] = [ fragment ! ... ! fragment ]

 where [fragment] is one of

 [EOC marker] = [ 0x80 ]
 [EOS marker] = [ 0xC0 ]
 [fragment extending to the end of block, last in a chunk] = [ 0x00 ! payload ]
 [fragment extending to the end of block, more follow] = [ 0x40 ! payload ]
 [limited size fragment] = [ header:1 ! payload ]

 The header of [limited size fragment] consists of two bit fragment type info
 followed by 6 bit, non-zero value encoding length of the fragment:

 [fragment header] = [ type:.2 ! value:.6 ]

 There are four types of fragments determined by the first 2 bits of the header:

 00 - small fragment which is the last fragment of a chunk,
 01 - small fragment with more fragments following it,
 10 - big fragment (more fragments follow),
 11 - huge fragment (more fragments follow).

 Encoding of the size of the fragment depends on its type:

 - for small fragments: size= value
 - for big fragments:   size= value << 6
 - for huge fragments:  size= value << 12

 For small fragments, second bit of the header determines if it is the last
 fragment of a chunk or there are more fragments to come. Chunk can't end with
 a big or huge fragment and thus for these fragments we always expect more
 fragments to come. [EOC marker] ends a chunk, even if the last fragment said
 that more fragments will follow.

 The biggest fragment size is 64*2^12 ~= 250 Kb. The format of fragment header
 puts constraints on possible fragment sizes. If a chunk of data has size not
 possible to encode by a single fragment header, it is split into several
 fragments of correct sizes.

/*************************************************************************
 INPUT BUFFER

 Stores bytes read from input stream. These bytes are stored in the region
 starting from begin and ending at pos (pos points one byte after the end of
 data). The bytes starting from begin belong to the current fragment. The next
 fragment starts at byte pointed by header (this byte contains fragment`s
 header). When all data from the current fragment have been read, begin==header.
 To start reading next fragment, it must be entered so that header is moved to
 point at the header of the fragment following it (this is done in the
 load_next_fragment() function).

 The header of next fragment can be inside the input buffer:

                               rest of input block
              next fragment   (still in the stream)

  begin        pos          header                  end

 In each case header points at the position where the header should be if
 the data were present in the buffer. End points one byte after the end of
 current input block. As with header, this can be inside the buffer (end <= pos)
 or still in the stream.
