LIBRARY VERSION DESIGN (EMBEDDED SERVER)


- The library version of MySQL server is the client library that contains embedded server.

- This client DLL has name : libmysqlclient_e (.la)

- The client application that supposed to use MySQL LV need to be rebuilt against libmysqlclient_e.la. The rebuild process is necessary, because libmysqlclient_e is a LIBTOOL object, which has the different LIBS list compared to the original libmysqlclient.la.

- The client and the server code run in the same process and the same thread;

- The server code is invoked when client writes the command to the net, and when connection is established;
