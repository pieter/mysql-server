This directory contains a test suite for mysql daemon. To run
the currently existing test cases, simply execute ./mysql-test-run in
this directory. It will fire up the newly built mysqld and test it.
Note that you do not have to have to do make install, and you could
actually have a co-existing MySQL installation - the tests will not
conflict with it.

All tests must pass. If one or more of them fail on your system, please
report the details to bugs@lists.mysql.com

You can create your own test cases. To create a test case:

 cd t
 vi test_case_name.test

 in the file, put a set of SQL commands that will create some tables,
 load test data, run some queries to manipulate it.

 then do ./mysql-test-run -record test_case_name
 and look at r/test_case_name.result - edit the result if necessary. If you
 have to edit it, you have found a bug.

To submit your test case, put your .test file and .result file(s) into
a tar.gz archive, add a README that explains the problem, ftp the 
archive to ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/ and send  a mail
to bugs@lists.mysql.com
