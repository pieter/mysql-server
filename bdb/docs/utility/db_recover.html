<h3><pre>db_recover [<b>-cVv</b>] [<b>-h home</b>] [<b>-t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]]</b>]</pre></h3>
<h1>Description</h1>
        <a name="3"><!--meow--></a>    
<p>The db_recover utility must be run after an unexpected application,
Berkeley DB, or system failure to restore the database to a consistent state.
All committed transactions are guaranteed to appear after db_recover
has run, and all uncommitted transactions will be completely undone.
<p>The options are as follows:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><b>-c</b><dd>Perform catastrophic recovery instead of normal recovery.
<p><dt><b>-h</b><dd>Specify a home directory for the database environment; by
default, the current working directory is used.
<p><dt><b>-t</b><dd>Recover to the time specified rather than to the most current possible
date.  The timestamp argument should be in the form
[[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS] where each pair of
letters represents the following:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>CC<dd>The first two digits of the year (the century).
<dt>YY<dd>The second two digits of the year.  If "YY" is specified, but "CC" is not,
a value for "YY" between 69 and 99 results in a "YY" value of 19.  Otherwise,
a "YY" value of 20 is used.
<dt>MM<dd>The month of the year, from 1 to 12.
<dt>DD<dd>The day of the month, from 1 to 31.
<dt>hh<dd>The hour of the day, from 0 to 23.
<dt>mm<dd>The minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.
<dt>SS<dd>The second of the minute, from 0 to 61.
</dl>
<p>If the "CC" and "YY" letter pairs are not specified, the values default
to the current year.  If the "SS" letter pair is not specified, the value
defaults to 0.
<p><dt><b>-V</b><dd>Write the version number to the standard output and exit.
<p><dt><b>-v</b><dd>Run in verbose mode.
</dl>
<p>In the case of catastrophic recovery, an archival copy, or
<i>snapshot</i> of all database files must be restored along with all
of the log files written since the database file snapshot was made.  (If
disk space is a problem, log files may be referenced by symbolic links).
For further information on creating a database snapshot, see
<a href="../ref/transapp/archival.html">Archival Procedures</a>.
For further information on performing recovery, see
<a href="../ref/transapp/recovery.html">Recovery Procedures</a>.
<p>If the failure was not catastrophic, the files present on the system at the
time of failure are sufficient to perform recovery.
<p>If log files are missing, db_recover will identify the missing
log file(s) and fail, in which case the missing log files need to be
restored and recovery performed again.
<p>The db_recover utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the
<b>-h</b> option, the environment variable <b>DB_HOME</b>, or,
because the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB
environment).  In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB
environment, db_recover should always be given the chance to detach from
the environment and exit gracefully.  To cause db_recover to release all
environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal
(SIGINT).
<p>The db_recover utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.
<h1>Environment Variables</h1>
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>DB_HOME<dd>If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable
DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as described
in <a href="../api_c/env_open.html">DBENV-&gt;open</a>.
