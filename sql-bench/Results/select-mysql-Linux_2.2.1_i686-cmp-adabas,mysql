Testing the speed of selecting on keys that consist of many parts
The test-table has 10000 rows and the test is done with 22 ranges.

Creating table
Inserting 10000 rows
Time to insert (10000):  5 wallclock secs ( 1.45 usr  0.33 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Testing big selects on the table
Time for select_big (70:17207):  1 wallclock secs ( 0.24 usr  0.09 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Time for select_range (410:127625):  9 wallclock secs ( 1.84 usr  0.61 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Time for min_max_on_key (70000): 195 wallclock secs (33.98 usr  4.55 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
45510 queries in 9102 loops of 10000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for count_on_key (50000): 660 wallclock secs (26.15 usr  3.48 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Estimated total time: 870 wallclock secs (63.67 usr  9.06 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
