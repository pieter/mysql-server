Windows building readme
======================================

----------------IMPORTANT----------------------------
This readme outlines the instructions for building 
MySQL for Windows staring from version 5.1.
This readme does not apply to MySQL versions 5.0 
or ealier.
-----------------------------------------------------

The Windows build system uses a tool named CMake to generate build files for
a variety of project systems.  This tool is combined with a set of jscript
files to enable building of MySQL for Windows directly out of a bk clone.
The steps required are below.

Step 1
------
Download and install CMake.  It can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org. 
Once it is installed, modify your path to make sure you can execute
the cmake binary.

Step 2
------
Download and install bison for Windows.  It can be downloaded from
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm.  Please download using
the link named "Complete package, excluding sources".  This includes an
installer that will install bison.  After the installer finishes, modify
your path so that you can execute bison.

Step 3
------
Clone your bk tree to any location you like.

Step 4
------
From the root of your bk clone, execute the command:  win\configure <options>.  
The options right now are WITH_INNODB and WITH_PARTITION.  So the command line
would look like:

win\configure WITH_INNODB WITH_PARTITION

These are the only two flags supported right now.  Others will come later.

Step 5
------
From the root of your bk clone, execute one of the batch files to generate the type
of project files you desire.

For Visual Studio 8, do win\build-vs8.
For Visual Studio 7.1, do win\build-vs71.

We will support building with nmake in the near future.

Step 6
------
From the root of your bk clone, start your build.

For Visual Studio, simply execute mysql.sln.  This will start the IDE and you can
click the build solution menu option.

Current issues
--------------
1.  Not all configurations are currently available.  i.e.  Classic, Pro, Max.  
Currently, only debug and release are available.  This will change in the near
future.

2.  The definitions set for features (partitioning, blackhole, etc) are not 
changed based on the options given with configure.  This will soon be fixed 
as well.
