# Show full process list with prepare
# To not show other connections, this must be the first test and we must
# have a server restart before this one

# We don't have any 4.1 tests as we use I_S to query the PROCESSLIST to
# exclude system threads that may/may not be active in the server
# (namely the ndb injector thread)

# End of 4.1 tests
