Testing the speed of inserting data into 1 table and do some selects on it.
The tests are done with a table that has 10000 rows.

Generating random keys
Creating tables
Inserting 10000 rows in order
Inserting 10000 rows in reverse order
Inserting 10000 rows in random order
Time for insert (30000): 733 secs (22.19 usr  6.46 sys = 28.65 cpu)

Testing insert of duplicates
Time for insert_duplicates (30000):  9 secs ( 3.57 usr  3.81 sys =  7.38 cpu)

Retrieving data from the table
Time for select_big (10:300000): 41 secs (14.31 usr 10.02 sys = 24.33 cpu)
Time for order_by_key (10:300000): 48 secs (13.45 usr 11.16 sys = 24.61 cpu)
Time for order_by (10:300000): 54 secs (12.73 usr 11.78 sys = 24.51 cpu)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
1740 queries in 1740 loops of 5000 loops took 602 seconds
Estimated time for select_range_prefix (5000:14616): 1729 secs ( 7.39 usr 12.30 sys = 19.68 cpu)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
690 queries in 690 loops of 5000 loops took 612 seconds
Estimated time for select_range (5000:5796): 4434 secs ( 7.54 usr 13.55 sys = 21.09 cpu)
Time for select_key_prefix (20000): 79 secs (11.74 usr 21.54 sys = 33.28 cpu)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
7302 queries in 3651 loops of 10000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for select_key (20000): 1646 secs (16.74 usr 27.42 sys = 44.15 cpu)

Test of compares with simple ranges
Time for select_range_prefix (20000:43500): 53 secs ( 7.34 usr 14.13 sys = 21.47 cpu)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
5280 queries in 132 loops of 500 loops took 603 seconds
Estimated time for select_range (20000:11484): 603 secs ( 2.41 usr  4.34 sys =  6.75 cpu)
Time for select_group (101): 91 secs ( 0.12 usr  0.17 sys =  0.29 cpu)
Time for min_max_on_key (3000): 12 secs ( 1.31 usr  3.39 sys =  4.70 cpu)
Time for min_max (60): 40 secs ( 0.09 usr  0.09 sys =  0.18 cpu)
Time for count_on_key (100): 102 secs ( 0.10 usr  0.12 sys =  0.22 cpu)
Time for count (100): 107 secs ( 0.11 usr  0.12 sys =  0.23 cpu)

Testing update with functions
Time for update_key (500):  51 secs ( 0.32 usr  0.40 sys =  0.72 cpu)
Time for update_key_big (480): 77 secs ( 0.29 usr  0.33 sys =  0.62 cpu)

Testing delete
Time for delete_key (500): 48 secs ( 0.39 usr  0.35 sys =  0.74 cpu)
Time for delete_big (12):  8 secs ( 0.02 usr  0.01 sys =  0.03 cpu)

Insert into table with 16 keys and with a primary key with 16 parts
Time for insert_key (10000): 241 secs ( 8.58 usr  2.07 sys = 10.65 cpu)

Testing update of keys
Time for update_of_primary_key_many_keys (256): 17 secs ( 0.10 usr  0.16 sys =  0.26 cpu)

Deleting everything from table
Time for delete_big (2):  4 secs ( 0.00 usr  0.00 sys =  0.00 cpu)

Estimated total time: 11695 secs ( 249.00 463.00 713.00)
