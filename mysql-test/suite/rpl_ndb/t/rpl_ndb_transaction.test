--echo ==== Test 2: Master crash before writing XID event on XA engine ====
# We now want to test the following scenario, to verify that BUG#26395
# has been fixed:

#   "master and slave have a transactional table that uses XA. Master
#    has AUTOCOMMIT on and executes a statement (in this case an
#    INSERT). Master crashes just before writing the XID event."

# In this scenario, master will roll back, so slave should not execute
# the statement, and slave should roll back later when master is
# restarted.

# However, we want the master to be alive so that we are sure it
# replicates the statement to the slave. So in the test case, we must
# therefore not crash the master. Instead, we fake the crash by just
# not writing the XID event to the binlog. This is done by the
# --debug=d,do_not_write_xid flag in the .opt file.

# So, unlike if the master had crashed, the master *will* execute the
# statement. But the slave should not execute it. Hence, after the
# first test is executed, the expected result on master is a table
# with one row, and on slave a table with no rows.

# To simulate the slave correctly, we wait until everything up to the
# XID is replicated. We cannot sync_slave_with_master, because that
# would wait for the transaction to end. Instead, we wait for
# "sufficiently long time". Then we stop the slave.

# Note: since this puts the master binlog in an inconsistent state,
# this should be the last test of the file.
