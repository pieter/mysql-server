Testing server 'PostgreSQL 6.4' at 1999-03-10  0:42:54

Testing the speed of selecting on keys that consist of many parts
The test-table has 10000 rows and the test is done with 1.5 ranges.

Creating table
Inserting 10000 rows
Time to insert (10000): 37 wallclock secs ( 6.11 usr  0.62 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Testing big selects on the table
Time for select_big (70:17207):  3 wallclock secs ( 0.18 usr  0.00 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Time for select_range (410:24731): 13 wallclock secs ( 0.79 usr  0.04 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Time for min_max_on_key (70000): 478 wallclock secs (17.06 usr  1.67 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
Note: Query took longer then time-limit: 600
Estimating end time based on:
19545 queries in 3909 loops of 10000 loops took 601 seconds
Estimated time for count_on_key (50000): 1537 wallclock secs (27.30 usr  3.43 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Estimated total time: 2069 wallclock secs (51.44 usr  5.76 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
