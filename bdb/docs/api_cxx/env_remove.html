<h3><pre>
#include &lt;db_cxx.h&gt;
<p>
int
DbEnv::remove(const char *db_home, u_int32_t flags);
</pre></h3>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The DbEnv::remove method destroys a Berkeley DB environment, if it is not
currently in use.  The environment regions, including any backing files,
are removed.  Any log or database files and the environment directory are
not removed.
<p>The <b>db_home</b> argument to DbEnv::remove is described in
<a href="../ref/env/naming.html">Berkeley DB File Naming</a>.
<p>If there are processes that have called <a href="../api_cxx/env_open.html">DbEnv::open</a> without
calling <a href="../api_cxx/env_close.html">DbEnv::close</a> (i.e., there are processes currently using
the environment), DbEnv::remove will fail without further action,
unless the <a href="../api_cxx/env_remove.html#DB_FORCE">DB_FORCE</a> flag is set, in which case
DbEnv::remove will attempt to remove the environment regardless
of any processes still using it.
<p>The result of attempting to forcibly destroy the environment when it is
in use is unspecified.  Processes using an environment often maintain open
file descriptors for shared regions within it.  On UNIX systems, the
environment removal will usually succeed and processes that have already
joined the region will continue to run in that region without change,
however processes attempting to join the environment will either fail or
create new regions.  On other systems (e.g., Windows/NT), where the
<b>unlink</b>(2) system call will fail if any process has an open
file descriptor for the file, the region removal will fail.
<p>Calling DbEnv::remove should not be necessary for most applications,
as the Berkeley DB environment is cleaned up as part of normal database recovery
procedures, however, applications may wish to call DbEnv::remove
as part of application shutdown to free up system resources.
Specifically, when the <a href="../api_cxx/env_open.html#DB_SYSTEM_MEM">DB_SYSTEM_MEM</a> flag was specified to
<a href="../api_cxx/env_open.html">DbEnv::open</a>, it may be useful to call DbEnv::remove in order
to release system shared memory segments that have been allocated.
<p>In the case of catastrophic or system failure, database recovery must be
performed (see <a href="../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a>), or the <a href="../api_cxx/env_open.html#DB_RECOVER">DB_RECOVER</a> and
<a href="../api_cxx/env_open.html#DB_RECOVER_FATAL">DB_RECOVER_FATAL</a> flags to <a href="../api_cxx/env_open.html">DbEnv::open</a> must be specified
when the environment is re-opened.  Alternatively, if recovery is not
required because no database state is maintained across failures, and
the <a href="../api_cxx/env_open.html#DB_SYSTEM_MEM">DB_SYSTEM_MEM</a> flag was not specified when the environment
was created, it is possible to clean up an environment by removing all
of the files in the environment directory that begin with the string
prefix "__db", as no backing files are created in any other directory.
<p>The <b>flags</b> value must be set to 0 or by bitwise inclusively <b>OR</b>'ing together one or more
of the following values.
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><a name="DB_FORCE">DB_FORCE</a><dd>If the <a href="../api_cxx/env_remove.html#DB_FORCE">DB_FORCE</a> flag is set, the environment is removed regardless
of any processes that may still using it, and, no locks are acquired
during this process.  (Generally, the <a href="../api_cxx/env_remove.html#DB_FORCE">DB_FORCE</a> flag is only
specified when applications were unable to shut down cleanly, and there
is a risk that an application may have died holding a Berkeley DB lock.)

naming for all users only if the DB_USE_ENVIRON flag is set.

<p>In multi-threaded applications, only a single thread may call
DbEnv::remove.
<p>A <a href="../api_cxx/dbenv_class.html">DbEnv</a> handle which has already been used to open an
environment should not be used to call the DbEnv::remove method, a new
<a href="../api_cxx/dbenv_class.html">DbEnv</a> handle should be created for that purpose.
<p>Once DbEnv::remove has been called, regardless of its return,
the Berkeley DB environment handle may not be accessed again.
<p>The DbEnv::remove method either returns a non-zero error value or throws an exception that
encapsulates a non-zero error value on failure, and returns 0 on success.

<p><dt>EBUSY<dd>The shared memory region was in use and the force flag was not set.
</dl>
<p>The DbEnv::remove method may fail and throw an exception or return a non-zero error for errors specified for other Berkeley DB and C library or system methods.
If a catastrophic error has occurred, the DbEnv::remove method may fail and either
return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a> or throw an exception encapsulating
<a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a>, in which case all subsequent Berkeley DB calls will fail
in the same way.
