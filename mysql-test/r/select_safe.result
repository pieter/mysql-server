The SELECT would examine too many records and probably take a very long time. Check your WHERE and use SET OPTION SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1 if the SELECT is ok
update t1 set b="a" limit 1;
update t1 set b="a" where b="b" limit 2;
delete from t1 where b="test" limit 1;
delete from t1 where a+0=1 limit 2;
drop table t1;
