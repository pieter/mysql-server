Testing the speed of creating and droping tables
All tests are done 1000 times

Okay..Let's make sure that our tables don't exist yet.

Testing create of tables
Time for create_table (1000): 80 secs (80.37 usr  0.00 sys = 80.37 cpu)

Accessing tables
Time to select_group (1000): 14 secs (14.25 usr  0.00 sys = 14.25 cpu)

Testing drop
Time for drop_table (1000): 19 secs (18.63 usr  0.00 sys = 18.63 cpu)

Testing create+drop
Time for create+drop (1000): 63 secs (63.53 usr  0.00 sys = 63.53 cpu)
Time for create_key+drop (1000): 52 secs (51.41 usr  0.00 sys = 51.41 cpu)
Total time: 228 secs (228.22 usr  0.00 sys = 228.22 cpu)
