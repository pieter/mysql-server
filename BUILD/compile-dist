# This script's purpose is to update the automake/autoconf helper scripts and
# to run a plain "configure" without any special compile flags. Only features
# that affect the content of the source distribution are enabled. The resulting
# tree can then be picked up by "make dist" to create the "pristine source
# package" that is used as the basis for all other binary builds.
