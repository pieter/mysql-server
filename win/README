Windows building readme
======================================

----------------IMPORTANT----------------------------
This readme outlines the instructions for building 
MySQL for Windows staring from version 5.0.
This readme does not apply to MySQL versions 5.1 
or ealier.
-----------------------------------------------------

The Windows build system uses a tool named CMake to generate build files for
a variety of project systems.  This tool is combined with a set of jscript
files to enable building of MySQL for Windows directly out of a bk clone.
The steps required are below.

Step 1
------
Download and install CMake.  It can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org. 
Once it is installed, modify your path to make sure you can execute
the cmake binary.

Step 2
------
Download and install bison for Windows.  It can be downloaded from
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm.  Please download using
the link named "Complete package, excluding sources".  This includes an
installer that will install bison.  After the installer finishes, modify
your path so that you can execute bison.

Step 3
------
Clone your bk tree to any location you like.

Step 4
------
From the root of your bk clone, execute the command:  win\configure <options>.  
The options right now are

    WITH_INNOBASE_STORAGE_ENGINE         Enable particular storage engines
    WITH_ARCHIVE_STORAGE_ENGINE
    WITH_BERKELEY_STORAGE_ENGINE
    WITH_BLACKHOLE_STORAGE_ENGINE
    WITH_EXAMPLE_STORAGE_ENGINE
    WITH_FEDERATED_STORAGE_ENGINE
    WITH_INNOBASE_STORAGE_ENGINE
    __NT__                               Enable named pipe support
    MYSQL_SERVER_SUFFIX=<suffix>         Server suffix, default none
    COMPILATION_COMMENT=<comment>        Server comment, default "Source distribution"
    MYSQL_TCP_PORT=<port>                Server port, default 3306
    DISABLE_GRANT_OPTIONS                Disables the use of --init-file and --skip-grant-tables
                                         options of mysqld.exe
    EMBED_MANIFESTS                      Embed custom manifests into final exes, otherwise VS
                                         default will be used. (Note - This option should only be
                                         used by MySQL AB.)
                                

So the command line could look like:

win\configure WITH_INNOBASE_STORAGE_ENGINE WITH_ARCHIVE_STORAGE_ENGINE MYSQL_SERVER_SUFFIX=-my-suffix

Step 5
------
From the root of your bk clone, execute one of the batch files to generate the type
of project files you desire.

For Visual Studio 8, do win\build-vs8.
For Visual Studio 7.1, do win\build-vs71.

We will support building with nmake in the near future.

Step 6
------
From the root of your bk clone, start your build.

For Visual Studio, simply execute mysql.sln.  This will start the IDE and you can
click the build solution menu option.

Current issues
--------------
1. After changing configuration (eg. adding or removing a storage engine), it
may be necessary to clean the build tree to remove any stale objects.

2. To use Visual C++ Express Edition you also need to install the Platform SDK.
Please see this link: http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/
At step 4 you only need to add the libraries advapi32.lib and user32.lib to
the file "corewin_express.vsprops" in order to avoid link errors.
